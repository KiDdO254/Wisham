# **Wisham — Digital Rental Management Platform**

## **Project Description**

_**Market Need**_

Traditional rental property management in Kenya still relies heavily on manual record-keeping, cash or untracked M-Pesa transactions, and in-person rent collection. These outdated methods lead to frequent rent arrears, disputes over payment records, poor maintenance tracking, and compliance challenges with evolving rental laws. Given Kenya's mobile money penetration (over 80%) and rapid smartphone adoption, there is a significant opportunity to digitize rental management and streamline landlord-tenant relationships.

_**Project Value**_

Wisham revolutionizes rental property operations by offering a comprehensive digital platform that automates rent collection, integrates with M-Pesa for seamless payments, manages leases and maintenance requests, and provides real-time financial and compliance insights. The platform reduces administrative burdens for landlords and property managers, enhances transparency for tenants, and supports scalable growth for rental businesses.
